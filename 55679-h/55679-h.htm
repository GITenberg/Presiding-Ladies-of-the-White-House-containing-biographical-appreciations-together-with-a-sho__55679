<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>America stands to-day among the greatest and most progressive
of the nations of the earth; and as the law of nations from
earliest times has been the decline and fall of one, as another
rises to prëeminence, it would seem that this great land of ours is fast
soaring towards the highest pinnacle of national attainment.</p>

<p>If a nation is great, it is made so by the men who make and enforce
its laws, who fill its positions of trust, who manipulate its finances, and who
prove worthy citizens of the land of their birth or adoption.</p>

<p>And who are responsible for the men?</p>

<p>Are not the women, the wives and mothers of the nation, the bearers
of this great burden of responsibility?</p>

<p>No nation has ever risen, or can rise above the level of its women,
and in no other country is this truth more obviously demonstrated than in
our own beloved and favored land.</p>

<p>Reasoning thus, we find that the American woman not only holds a
high position of trust, but it is conceded by all who know her, that she
fills it worthily, and is capable of meeting the varied demands upon her
with rare tact and skill.</p>

<p>There are no women in the world to-day who are more truly the
cynosure of all eyes, than are our own. They stand in the glare of public
life in the highest circles of their own land, and are closely allied to royalty
abroad, participating in, or presiding at, many of the functions of almost
every foreign court, and everywhere the homage which is their due is freely
accorded them.</p>

<p>There are two attributes of the American woman which are undeniably
predominant in her nature, and these are <em>adaptability</em> and <em>individuality</em>.</p>

<p>They are displayed by the members of all ranks and classes, but
probably the twenty-five women who form the coterie of “First Ladies of
the Land” in our republican court at Washington, have had as great, if
not greater, opportunities for exercising these qualities than any who have
entered only into court life abroad.</p>

<p>“Noblesse oblige” is true in all stations of life, whether it be the
nobility of honorable living or of high social birth, but in royal circles
there is a code of etiquette which is enforced from generation to generation,
just as royal sons and daughters are born to royal parents, and so
its followers abide by its mandates as a matter of course. In a democratic
country like America, no such rule obtains, for the children of a President
of the United States, after their father’s term expires, may relapse into
social inconspicuousness and seldom appear before the public, instead of, as
in royalty, inheriting their father’s official greatness.</p>

<p>We have but one instance of the son of a President following in his
father’s footsteps, and only one where a grandson did likewise. The
wife of a President may have been born in affluence and social prominence,
or she may have passed her early years in the humblest environment,
as was the case with a number of the women who have presided at the
White House, but in every instance the duties of hostess have been faithfully
and creditably discharged, while natural ease, grace and tact, combined
with this wonderful power of adaptation, have rendered the hospitality of the
White House unquestionably refined, and marked by the highest breeding.</p>

<p>Some of the women who have held this exalted position have been called
to it while little more than young girls, and others have assumed its responsibilities
and obligations late in life, yet all have upheld the dignity of the
nation of whose social life they were, for the time being, the highest exponents.</p>

<p>Can this always be said of the life at foreign courts?</p>

<p>When we consider the laxity and licentiousness of some of the so-called
nobility, and the freedom of royal personages in their accepted code
of morals, we realize that the life at the White House at Washington,
makes for all that is pure in social life, having had no breath of scandal
attaching to it in all the years since its establishment, and having set an
example of moral righteousness for all the homes in the country at whose
head it stands.</p>

<p>The individuality of each hostess has left its imprint upon the history
of her time from the pomp and ceremony of Martha Washington’s régime,
to the greater freedom from restraint of that of “Dolly Madison.” We
hear also of the extreme “simplicity” of Jefferson’s administration and the
social festivities which marked Mrs. Grant’s residence at the White House.
Mrs. Polk abolished dancing, while Mrs. Hayes banished wine, from their
entertainments. Mrs. Fillmore founded the library, for of books there were
none when she was installed as mistress of the White House; and Mrs.
McElroy marked the administration of her brother, Chester A. Arthur,
with the acme of refined hospitality.</p>

<p>The list might be prolonged, but instances enough have been cited to
show that while the women who preside over the nation’s home at Washington,
must conform to certain accepted rules of etiquette, there is left
sufficient scope for each to display individual tastes and characteristics,
without in any way lowering the tone of the social life of the Executive
Mansion.</p>

<p>The author who has with marvelous industry and good taste, written
these condensed biographies of our country’s most eminent women, deserves
the thanks of all; yet such short sketches as are embodied in this volume,
can give but little knowledge of facts concerning lives with so much interest
attaching to them that a history of each would offer absorbing entertainment
to the lover of biography, but they can serve to enlighten every
intelligent reader sufficiently to arouse a desire for more information relating
to these women, famous in the story of their country’s social and political
events, and to awaken a feeling of pride that these queens of a republican
court have no peers in any foreign realm.</p>

<p>Martha Dandridge, of Virginia, was
married at nineteen years of age to Daniel Parke
Custis. At an early age she was left a widow with
two children, Martha and John Parke Custis. In
1759 she married George Washington, thus becoming
the wife of the first President of the United
States. Accomplished, wealthy and fascinating, fond
of ceremony, yet hospitable, her entertainments
at Mt. Vernon were world-famous. The White
House was not erected until after Washington’s
death, hence she never presided there. New York
being the Capital of the Country during Washington’s
administration her court was held in that
city, refined taste and abundant wealth admitting
of appropriate display. Her patriotism was equal
to that of her husband and led her through many
trying scenes and privations during the Revolution.
She died in her seventy-first year, having gradually
failed in health since her husband’s death, nearly
three years previous.</p>

<p>Abigail Smith, of Weymouth, Mass.,
became the wife of John Adams at twenty. Ill
health during her early years retarded her education,
but her strong mind overcame this difficulty.
Her letters to her husband and her son prove her
mental powers and strong character, and many of
them have been published on account of their
literary and historical value. During her husband’s
term the Capital was removed to Washington,
and, though the White House was not yet completed,
and the city was only a straggling town,
the ceremony of Washington’s time was resumed
there during her short reign of only half a year.
In private life she was her husband’s constant
companion, until, at the age of seventy-four, eight
years prior to her husband’s death, she died, leaving
the record of a unique life. She was the
mother, as well as the wife, of a President, John
Quincy Adams being the eldest of her three sons,
and in this respect she stands alone.</p>

<p>Martha Jefferson Randolph,
the elder of the President’s two daughters, presided
at the White House whenever possible during her
father’s administrations, his wife having died nineteen
years before his election. The White House,
however, during his terms, was practically without
a mistress, although at times Mrs. Madison also
acted in that capacity. Mrs. Randolph was eminently
fitted for such a sphere, but was able to
assume its duties only twice. Having received the
advantages of foreign education and travel, and the
continual association with men of letters, she was a
most brilliant woman, and had her tastes been less
domestic she would have shone in society. She
gave her father unremitting care when, after his
retirement from public life, he settled at his estate
Monticello, where two years after his death her
husband also passed away. Monticello was then
sold and the remaining eight years of her life
were spent among her children.</p>

One year after his death, when twenty-two,
she married James Madison. Her kind
heart, frank, cordial manners, and personal beauty
made her very popular. When she presided at
the White House her tact, ready recognition of
every one, and her remembrance of events concerning
them increased this feeling. Although
her entertainments lacked the ceremony of past
administrations, “Dolly” Madison was considered
a charming hostess. While she was extremely
charitable, she always dispensed her husband’s
wealth with prudence and judgment. The war of
1812 showed her true nobility in many ways, and
it was she who saved the Stuart portrait of Washington
when the British were about to pillage and
burn the White House. The Government bought
from her Madison’s Record of the Debates in
Congress from 1782-1787, for $30,000.</p>

was removed to Philadelphia, where they
resided until 1794, when Monroe was made Envoy
Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to
France. Her husband’s several foreign positions
of trust obliged them to live much abroad. She
saved the life of Madame de Lafayette, who, upon
the very day of Mrs. Monroe’s call at the prison,
was to have been beheaded; but the powerful support
of the American Minister’s wife caused her
liberation. Mrs. Monroe was elegant, accomplished,
dignified and charming, and her “drawing rooms”
were more ceremonious than those of Mrs. Madison.
She died suddenly, one year before her husband,

various accomplishments rendered her capable of
adding much to this period’s noted brilliancy.
All admired her, even when party spirit quenched
unbiased judgment. In all points of etiquette she
was arbiter, the President deferring everything to
her opinion. Her four children were born in the
White House. Early in 1836 she returned to
Tennessee, as her health was failing, hoping for
renewed strength; but consumption developed, and

<p>Mary Todd, born in Lexington, Ky., had
from girlhood a supreme desire to become mistress
of the White House, which, however, did not
seem probable when she married Abraham Lincoln
in 1842, but later her ambition was realized. She
was small, attractive in appearance, inclined to
stoutness, self possessed in manner, and would
have enjoyed her high position had not the troublous
events of the Rebellion prevented all festivities
and converted the White House into a
public institution. The death of her second son
preyed sorely upon her, but when in 1865 her
husband was assassinated, the shock was too great,
and that, added to the blow of her youngest boy’s
death soon after his father’s, partly unsettled her
reason. Although she traveled much abroad, she
never recovered, mentally or physically. She died
of paralysis in her sister’s home at Springfield,
Ill., in 1882, and was interred in the Lincoln
Monument vault with her husband and children.</p>

<p>Eliza McCardle, of Tennessee, married
in 1826 Andrew Johnson, a tailor, eighteen years
old, whose early education she superintended
perseveringly until his learning exceeded her own.
Her character was simple, true and unostentatious,
the duties of wife and mother being always conscientiously
fulfilled. Her health being undermined
by suffering during the Rebellion, she was
a confirmed invalid when called to the White
House, therefore Mrs. Patterson, her eldest daughter,
became hostess. She presided with simple
elegance, ease, grace and remarkable tact during
her father’s stormy administration. Their home
life was delightful, and when they left Washington
the whole family was much regretted socially
and by all retainers, as their popularity was widespread.
Mrs. Johnson’s influence over her husband
was always very marked, and throughout his
life she was his greatest helper and adviser. She
survived him only six months.</p>

<p>Julia Dent, in 1844, became engaged to

but they married in 1848. Years of failure and
poverty followed, but her faith in his ability
survived, and when his military prowess made
him famous, she shared his triumphs. Later, as
the President’s wife, she was most hospitable,
entertaining extensively in private as well as in
public life, making Grant’s administrations, socially,
very notable. When his term expired, General
and Mrs. Grant journeyed around the world
and met with a continuous ovation. A special
feature of it was the dinner given to Mrs. Grant
by the wife of China’s Viceroy, which was the
first of its kind. During her husband’s last illness
she was his constant nurse, and was always an
adored mother. Her remains, with those of her
husband, share the famous mausoleum, built as a
memorial to him, on Riverside Drive, New York
City, the site of which she herself chose.</p>

Frank, cordial, hospitable and beautiful, she freely
expressed her pleasure at becoming mistress of the
Executive Mansion, winning many friends by her
sunny smile and sincere greeting. She was very
popular, although she displeased a certain few
among her guests by banishing wine from the
White House table, thereby gaining strong support
from the temperance advocates. A fine oil painting
of her was added by these adherents to the
collection at the Mansion, Frances Willard making

their silver wedding was celebrated,
the occasion arousing national interest. She did
not long survive her husband, who died at their

<p>Lucretia Rudolph, born in Hiram,
Ohio, married James Abram Garfield in 1868,
soon after he became President of Hiram College,
where both studied. The marriage was ideal, his
wife’s intelligent sympathy and co-operative ability
aiding greatly in his advancement to his high
office. Through the terrible ordeal of his assassination,
painful illness and death, Mrs. Garfield
was vastly sustained by her power of self-control.
Her short stay at the White House proved her
tactful and cordial in dispensing public and private
hospitality, gaining for her the nation’s love and
sympathy in her sorrow. President Garfield’s was
the first mother of a President to reside at the
Executive Mansion, although others had seen their
sons thus honored. A fund of over three hundred
and fifty thousand dollars was partially raised for
the Garfield family before the President’s death,
and the knowledge of this was a great comfort to
him in his dying moments.</p>

the Government, explored the Amazon River in
1857, but she died in January, 1880, less than one
year previous to his election as Vice-President. Mrs.
McElroy was specially adapted to fill such a position
from her natural tact and previous social experience.
Her residence at the White House was
therefore marked by graceful and dignified hospitality
and the task of entertainment was greatly
lightened by the extreme geniality of the President.
Like her brother, she was of fine and imposing

<p>Ida Saxton, daughter of a prominent
banker of Canton, Ohio, married Wm. McKinley
in January, 1871. She was a devoted wife and
inspiring companion in whose sound judgment her
husband placed entire faith, while her personal
attractions were also great. An enduring sorrow,
caused by the deaths, in infancy, of the two children
born to them, added to a chronic physical
ailment, rendered her an invalid. Therefore,
when appearing at public functions she received
her guests seated. However, the death of the

situation resulting from the war with Spain, suppressed
the festivities at the White House temporarily.
Mrs. McKinley sustained a terrible shock
in the assassination of her husband, early in September,
1901, from which she has never entirely
rallied, although she shows great resignation,
and a devotion to her husband’s memory as great
as that bestowed upon him in life.</p>

<h2 id="THE_WHITE_HOUSE">THE WHITE HOUSE</h2>

<p>The site for the erection of the White House, or the “President’s
Palace” as it was termed on some of the earlier maps, was selected
by President Washington and General L’Enfant when they laid out
the city of Washington in 1792. The corner stone was placed in
that year.</p>

<p>The plans were procured by competition, which gave the award to
James Hoban, a distinguished young architect from Dublin, afterward identified
for many years with the architectural work of the capital city. By the
architects of to-day his design is considered to surpass anything of a similar
style since constructed in this country. The White House was so called
after the home of Martha Washington in Virginia.</p>

<p>According to the original plan, the building was 160 feet long. The
North and South porches, constructed from designs made by Latrobe in
1803, were added twenty-five years after the first occupancy of the house;
and in Jefferson’s time and under his direction, terraces were built extending
150 feet east and west of the mansion. The West Terrace, enclosed
in glass and otherwise disguised, became in time the Conservatory so dear
to the heart of the Washington sight-seer. The East Terrace was removed
about the time of the Civil War, but, happily, both of these were restored
and beautified during the general making-over of the house in 1902.</p>

<p>The White House, when President Adams came to take possession
of it in 1800, was neither finished nor furnished, and its surroundings
were rough and unattractive, little or no effort having been made to reclaim
the adjacent country from its state of mud and ragged woodland.
From time to time Congress made small appropriations for the adornment
of the Executive Mansion, and this money was spent more or less
wisely by the several administrations in their efforts to make the official
residence comfortable. An appropriation of fifty thousand dollars was made
to President Madison after the fire of 1814 for the purpose of refurnishing;
but despite the expenditure of more than two million dollars upon
the furnishing and decorating of the building during the first three-quarters
of a century of its existence, it contained but few articles of value at the
time of the remodelling under President Roosevelt.</p>

<p>It was originally intended that the public offices should be separate
from the President’s home, and previous to 1814 the Executive Departments
occupied small detached buildings in the White House grounds.
But of necessity the President’s privacy was invaded by the business of his
office, until finally, during the war, President Lincoln set aside the second
story of the East Wing for official business purposes. This invasion
limited the accommodations for comfortable living and introduced a degree
of publicity into the family life of the Chief Executive that was far from
agreeable. But these and many other discomforts were at last removed by
the construction of the new office building and by the remodelling of the
entire old building. There is now little business of an official nature conducted
in the house proper, and the East Wing has been reclaimed for
domestic purposes. With the exception of the outside walls, scarcely any
part of the building has been left unchanged. The old flooring, long in
a dangerous condition, has been replaced by new, supported upon steel
beams. The latest improvements in heating, lighting, and plumbing have
supplanted the old-fashioned arrangements tolerated by many administrations.
In this process, it is to be regretted that many nooks and crannies
of historic interest have been obliterated, but it is comforting to know
that the alterations will preserve in good condition and for a much longer
period the main structure and the chief beauties of the old house.</p>

<p id="East"><b>The East Room.</b>&mdash;It is difficult to realize in viewing this magnificent
apartment that it was at one time used by Mrs. John Adams as a drying-room
for the family linen. The East Room was not finished until 1836, and
a bare, bleak place it must have been in those early days. In former times
state banquets were held here, but, in more recent years, it has been chiefly
used for public receptions. During the administration of President Arthur
this room was redecorated and refurnished, and afterward no changes of
importance were made until 1902, when, with the rest of the building, it
underwent almost complete transformation. The walls previous to this
period were hung with historical portraits, among them the Gilbert Stuart portrait
of Washington, saved from the fire of 1814 by Mrs. Madison; but these
were removed, as were also the pillars and beams of the old room, to give
place to the present beautiful scheme of decoration. The walls and ceilings
are now of white; the spaces over the doors and windows contain low-relief
panels, each illustrating one of the fables of Æsop. The ceiling is most
elaborate, but of delicate design; from each of its three panels depend the
splendid cut-glass chandeliers, which have taken the place of the former
larger, but less artistic ones. Four beautiful mantels of colored marbles are
features of the recent remodelling. The draperies are of rich yellow silk.</p>

</div>

<p id="Blue"><b>The Blue Room.</b>&mdash;It is in this famous apartment that the President
receives his guests upon state occasions. The room is considered the handsomest
in the house in point of decoration, and also in its beautiful proportions.
The floor is a fine, highly polished parquetry, and the walls are covered
with a heavy steel-blue silk with yellow embroideries at the ceiling and
wainscot. In the pattern of this embroidery and in the decoration of the ceiling
and the window hangings the star is used with graceful effect. Each of
the three windows is surmounted by a golden eagle. A feature of the room
is the fine marble mantel with its supports representing sheaves of arrows
tipped with gold bronze. When receiving in the Blue Room, the presidential
party stands in front of the windows, but formerly they occupied the north
end of the room. A heavy rope of silk encloses a passageway for the
procession of guests, who must pass from the Red Room into the presence
of the host and thence into the Green Room. This change is one
of the many that were brought about by the rearrangement of the entire
premises. During the administration of John Adams, the Blue Room was
used as a sort of vestibule, its convenient location making it available for
this purpose.</p>

</div>

<p id="Red"><b>The Red Room.</b>&mdash;In early times this was the anteroom to the Library
and the Cabinet Room. It adjoins the State Dining Room, and by recent
changes has been turned into a smoking room, except when it is required for
service on receiving days. It is then used as formerly, in conjunction with the
series of state parlors. Its walls are covered with dark red velvet and hung
with historical portraits. Its marble mantel is one of those which formerly
adorned the State Dining Room, the other was placed in the Green Room.</p>

<p id="Green"><b>The Green Room.</b>&mdash;In old times the Green Room was the family dining
room. The present Private Dining Room was then used for state dinners.
Like the Blue Room, its walls are hung with velvet; here, however, the
color is an exquisite silvery green. Some of the original paintings which,
are reproduced in the White House Gallery of Portraits of the Presidents,
also adorn the walls of this room.</p>

<p id="Dining"><b>State and Private Dining Rooms.</b>&mdash;The State Dining Room was enlarged
in 1902 by the addition of a corridor from which the private stairway
led. This necessitated the removal of that portion of the stairs. The
room now measures forty by fifty feet and will accommodate as many as
one hundred guests at table. The walls are of panelled oak, and the
window draperies of heavy green velvet. Flemish tapestries of the sixteenth
century are a feature of the room, which is further decorated by a
number of heads&mdash;trophies of the chase in American hunting-grounds&mdash;arranged
around the beautifully carved cornice. The furniture is of red
mahogany; it includes two tables, the larger, crescent in shape, and the
smaller a rounded oblong.</p>

<p>An interesting feature of the furnishings of the State Dining Room is
the complete service of china and cut glass, manufactured from special
designs made exclusively for the White House and selected by Mrs.
Roosevelt from a number submitted to her for approval. The design is
simple but rich in effect and the china is of the purest texture, the whole
having been very costly. The glass, which includes many pieces, is of the
best American cut.</p>

<p>The Private Dining Room has been remodelled in a style essentially
colonial, with an attractive color scheme of ivory white and red. The ceiling
is domed and the window hangings are of red velvet. The furniture in
this apartment harmonizes with the general plan of decoration, it also being
distinctly colonial in design.</p>

<p id="Library"><b>The Library.</b>&mdash;The room, which is oval in shape, is situated on the
second story of the Executive Mansion and was once used as the President’s
office, but is now converted into a private sitting room. It was during
President Fillmore’s administration that the Library was first organized, an
appropriation being made for that purpose. The low book-cases line the
walls which contain over seven thousand volumes, principally literature of
an historical and classical character, and chiefly of Mrs. Fillmore’s own
selection. She greatly deplored the lack of books in the White House
and urged the need of a more extensive Library. However, it did not
progress, as it should have done, and is not catalogued.</p>

<p id="Executive"><b>The Executive Office.</b>&mdash;From the time of President Lincoln’s administration
the business of the White House began to encroach seriously upon the
living quarters. The discomfort and inconvenience resulting from this combination
of public and private life under one roof&mdash;and that a roof of very
limited dimensions&mdash;had long been realized. Plans to relieve the situation
were occasionally brought forward, but nothing was accomplished until 1902,
when the reconstruction of the entire establishment took place. It was then
that the one-storied and basement building was erected at the end of the
West Terrace for the accommodation of the Executive Offices. The
architects have placed the structure most effectively in its relation to its
surroundings. It contains a Reception Room, the President’s suite of
rooms, the offices of the President’s Secretary and Assistant Secretary, telegraph
and telephone rooms and several other offices. The building is
comparatively small and will probably give place to a larger one in the

<h2 id="OFFICIAL_ETIQUETTE">OFFICIAL ETIQUETTE</h2>

<p>As the State social functions in America are not hedged about by
the privileges and prerogatives to which rank, station and birth alone
entitle the holder in monarchical courts, the ceremonies, observances
and ritual are, in comparison, simple and meagre. No special lessons
are required nor are rehearsals needed to carry off with proper dignity any of
the observances of state courtesy. Nevertheless, while there is an absence of
that ostentatious display that marks the ceremonies of the courts of Europe,
official etiquette in America is prescribed by a rigid code established by the
highest authorities, which none dare disregard.</p>

<p>It is only natural that state receptions should be governed by more arbitrary
rules than those which direct purely social intercourse. It must be remembered
that when an official reception is held, it is always an official duty that is being
performed. The state forms and ceremonies which have obtained in America
have varied from time to time according to the usages of the day and the taste
of the national hostess. They have, at times, been further modified by periods
of national calamity, war and the death of immediate relatives, but through all
this variation and modification there has run the golden thread of democratic
simplicity so dear to the national heart.</p>

<p>The period of Washington’s administration must be regarded as a time of
transition. Nor is it to be wondered at that much formality and stateliness marked
the dispensation of national hospitality in the beginning of the nation’s development.
The term “colonial” is to-day associated in our minds with a courtly,
stately conventionality peculiarly its own. Men and women of that time, who
either at first hand or through their mothers and fathers, had received their education
in courtesy, grace and proper behavior from the customs of England, could
not easily shake off that second nature and no doubt fretted over the meagre
means of gratifying their wishes; but as soon as they were cut off by their own
desire from this influence and became self-dependent, that pure simplicity nurtured
by individual worth became evident. It is not surprising that in the
earliest period the Executive Mansion was a place of stately and continuous
reception and that Martha Washington is famous for the dignity, grace and
splendor of her social reign: but, on the other hand, the simplicity of Jefferson’s
time has passed into a proverb, and was such as to excite comment even abroad.
The youth, gaiety and impetuous brilliancy of “Dolly Madison” contributed largely
to the breaking down of much of the severity and conventionality which preceded
her time.</p>

<p>The President is the leader of social as well as of official life. While he is
accessible to all to the extent that all may call upon him, he is not expected to
return any visits. He, of course, has the privilege of calling upon a friend. The
same is equally true of the wife of the President. He is always addressed as
“Mr. President.” He can not leave the country, and in this respect is under
greater restrictions than are any of the crowned heads of Europe. Under this
“unwritten law” a foreign legation in Washington is construed as being foreign
ground and may not be entered by the President. Neither can he set foot upon
a foreign vessel. The only formal calls that he can make are those upon a
President elect, an ex-President, a President or reigning monarch of a foreign
state visiting Washington. It is regarded as an impropriety for him to accept an
invitation to dinner at any time or to receive other than very intimate friends on
Sunday. He carries no personal card but one reading simply “The President.”
He can not accept valuable gifts and if such are tendered they are usually placed
in the National Museum. It is not expected that he should allow himself to be
interviewed.</p>

<p>The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court ranks next to the President socially.
He takes precedence over all others because his office is for life while that of
others is only temporary. Below him in turn socially come the Vice-President,
the Speaker of the House, the General of the Army and the Admiral of the Navy.
It is considered one of the first duties of the Members of the House of Representatives
to call upon these when coming to Washington. The social rank of
women is decided by that of the husband or father.</p>

<p>The Inaugural Ball is the first social event in the life of the newly inaugurated
President. It is always held upon the evening of the day of his inauguration, and
partakes more of the nature of a reception than a ball for it is so largely attended
that dancing is an impossibility. It is usually held in one of the departmental
buildings. For several days after his inauguration, public informal receptions
follow and a week or more is consumed in receptions during the day and dinners
at night. These latter are classified, to a certain extent, so that all branches of
the official service are formally recognized. Saturday is the official reception day
at the White House. The public receptions which are held from the first of
January until the beginning of Lent were inaugurated by President Jackson. The
guests assemble in the East Room and as quickly as this is filled the President
greets them as they pass out. The formal receptions are not held so frequently
as previously, on account of the great increase in the number of Senators and Representatives.
This is compensated for by inviting some Members of Congress to
state dinners and entertaining others with less ceremony.</p>

<p>The scene at a formal or official reception is a brilliant one. The Government
officials, the officers of the Army and Navy, and the foreign legations
mingle together in uniform, and the ladies are not in full dress but in reception
toilettes. Diplomats and attachés wear their court costumes. The President
stands at the head of the line, next to him his wife who invites several prominent
ladies to assist her in receiving. As the guests enter they pass down the
receiving line until they have greeted all of the ladies of the receiving party. The
daughters of the household of a state official are not invited to state dinners unless
the daughter is the female representative of the family.</p>

<p>The general conduct of, and the social observances at these several ceremonies
are the same as those which direct social observances elsewhere in good
society. The cards of invitation and responses to the ordinary receptions do not
differ from those in other American homes; but at the state dinners and official
receptions, which are to be regarded in some sense as an interchange of international
courtesy, the rules of attendance are very strict and no one would think
of neglecting to attend without an eminently satisfactory excuse.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
